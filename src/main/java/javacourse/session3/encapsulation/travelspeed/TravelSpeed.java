/**
 * This class illustrates an example of encapsulation. 
 * We imagine that a client gives us a distance that he/she traveled and the
 * time needed to travel that distance, and we have to give back the average
 * speed.
 * Suppose that our first version had everything in km, but that for some reasons
 * we have now to move to miles. However, we don't want that our client has to
 * change the own code.
 * Therefore we need to implement a transformation method that translates from
 * km to miles and vice versa. Moreover, we have to prevent the user to directly
 * access the fields of the class, because we want them to always be in miles.
 * We then make them private, and write getters and setters which use the
 * (private) transformation method. In this way, with respect to before we only
 * need to change getters, setters and the constructor, and to define the
 * conversion method, keeping the rest of the code as is.

	 * this change on the backstage of our code, so that the user does not have to
