 * In this class we see an example of how methods overloading can help us making
 * the life of somebody using our class easier if possible: here we write a method
 * to compute the perimeter of a triangle, so the general formula would of course
 * ask us to sum the length of the three sides. However, we maybe don't want somebody 
 * to give the length of all the three sides if we know they have equal length!
 * On the other hand, it would not make sense to call the method differently if it does
 * the same thing, i.e., compute a perimeter. So, here methods overloading comes into play.
 * Same thing if two sides have same length.
