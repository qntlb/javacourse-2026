 * This class serves as an example of a possible use of static fields.

 * want to know the total amount of money we lend to our customers for
 * mortgages: we are a small bank, so we don't like to be too exposed. Thus we
 * need the total amount of loaned money to be shared across all objects of the class Mortgage.
 * This is what we get with a static field. Note that the value of the static field is stored
 * in a shared location only once for all objects of the class.
