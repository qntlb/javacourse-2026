/**
 * Example of a derived class when the parent class has only constructors with
 * arguments: in this case, you must explicitly call the constructor of the
 * parent class, using "super". The reason for this is that we need to pass the
 * arguments to the correct constructor we want to call. Note: if the parent class has also a
 * default constructor, its default constructor gets called if you don't specify
 * any "super". Try to verify this behaviour adding a default constructor to
 * Sportsman and to TennisPlayer.
 * Note that a tennis player IS a sportsman. This is a very simple example of inheritance.
