/**
 * This class shows delegation through composition: you have to define a class
 * Car, and you want to use the only method of the class Engine to start it.
 * Thinking in this way, you might think to use inheritance. However, inheritance
 * usually expresses a relation of the type "DerivedClass is a type of BaseClass",
 * whereas we cannot really say that Car "is of type" Engine. We could say more
 * that Car "has" an Engine: in this case, composition is what we need: Car has
 * a field of type Engine, which implements a method start().
 * Car also has a method start() which uses an object of type Engine and asks it
 * to call the engine() method of Engine. Car is in fact DELEGATING
 * to Engine the implementation of the method.
