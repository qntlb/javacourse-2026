/**
 * Whenever you manipulate an object, what you’re manipulating is the reference,
 * so when you assign “from one object to another” you’re actually assigning to
 * a variable a reference to the same object. This means that if you say c = d for
 * objects, you end up with both c and d pointing to the object that,
 * originally, only d pointed to. This class is an example that demonstrates this
 * behavior.
